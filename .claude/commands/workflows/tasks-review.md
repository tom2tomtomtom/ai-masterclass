# Tasks Review

Display and analyze all tasks from the unified tasks.md file.

## Process

### 1. Load Tasks File
Read `.claude-suite/project/tasks.md` if it exists.

### 2. Display Tasks by Priority

#### 游뚿 Critical Tasks
Show all tasks marked as CRITICAL or blocking deployment.

#### 游댮 High Priority
Tasks that should be addressed in the current sprint.

#### 游리 Medium Priority
Important tasks that can wait for next sprint.

#### 游릭 Low Priority
Nice-to-have improvements and optimizations.

### 3. Display Tasks by Source

#### Agent-OS Tasks (Planning & Development)
- Feature implementations
- Spec completions
- Architecture decisions

#### Codebase-OS Tasks (Quality & Maintenance)
- Refactoring needs
- Code cleanup
- Performance optimizations

#### Testing Suite Tasks (Validation & Deployment)
- Missing tests
- Failed test fixes
- Deployment blockers

### 4. Task Statistics

Generate summary:
- Total tasks by priority
- Tasks by age (how long they've been open)
- Tasks by source command
- Overdue tasks (if dates provided)

### 5. Actionable Insights

Provide recommendations:
- Which tasks to tackle first
- Tasks that might be outdated
- Dependencies between tasks
- Quick wins vs long-term improvements

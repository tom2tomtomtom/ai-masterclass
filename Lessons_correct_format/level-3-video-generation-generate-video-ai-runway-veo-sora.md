**Component 3: Environment/Setting** (Where it takes place)
**Component 4: Style/Mood** (How it should look and feel)
**Component 5: Technical Specifications** (Camera work, lighting, etc.)

**Before/After Example - Try This Formula:**
```
WEAK PROMPT: "A person walking"
STRONG PROMPT USING FORMULA:
- Subject: "A confident businesswoman in a navy suit"
- Action: "walking purposefully down a modern office hallway"
- Environment: "in a glass-walled corporate building with city views"
- Style: "cinematic, professional, inspiring mood"
- Technical: "smooth tracking shot, natural lighting, 4K quality"
```

#### Industry-Specific Prompt Strategies

**For Marketing Agencies:**
Focus on brand storytelling and emotional connection
```
Example: "A diverse team collaborating around a modern conference table, 
animated discussion with laptops and sketches, bright creative office space, 
energetic and innovative atmosphere, dynamic camera movement capturing engagement"
```

**For Enterprise Companies:**
Emphasize professionalism and reliability
```
Example: "Executive presenting quarterly results on large screen, 
confident gestures highlighting growth charts, modern boardroom setting, 
professional and authoritative tone, steady camera with subtle zoom on key moments"
```

**For Startups:**
Highlight innovation and agility
```
Example: "Young entrepreneurs brainstorming in a vibrant co-working space, 
rapid idea exchange with sticky notes and whiteboards, energetic startup environment, 
creative and dynamic mood, handheld camera style for authentic feel"
```

### Phase 3: Advanced Techniques - Elevating Your Results

You're doing great! Now let's explore advanced techniques that will set your videos apart from basic AI-generated content.

## 3. How to Transform Images into Videos

### Step 1: Preparing Your Images for Video Conversion

**Image Requirements Checklist:**

✅ **Resolution**: Minimum 1024x1024 pixels for best results  
✅ **Format**: JPG or PNG (PNG preferred for transparency)  
✅ **Quality**: High resolution, sharp focus  
✅ **Composition**: Clear subject, good lighting  
✅ **Aspect Ratio**: Match your desired video output  

**How to Optimize Images Before Upload:**

1. **Resize Your Image**
   - Use Canva, Photoshop, or free tools like GIMP
   - Target 1920x1080 for 16:9 videos
   - Target 1080x1920 for 9:16 vertical videos

2. **Enhance Quality**
   - Increase contrast and saturation slightly
   - Ensure sharp focus on main subject
   - Remove distracting background elements if possible

3. **Consider the Story**
   - Choose images that suggest movement or action
   - Images with clear foreground/background work best
   - Portraits and product shots are ideal candidates

### Step 2: How to Create Image-to-Video in Runway

**Step-by-Step Image Animation:**

1. **Upload Your Image**

  1. Simplify prompt and remove any potentially problematic terms
  2. Try generating during off-peak hours (early morning/late evening)
  3. Break complex prompts into simpler components

**Problem: Poor Motion Quality**
- **Cause**: Motion settings too high or conflicting movement descriptions
- **Solution**:
  1. Reduce motion setting to 3-5 for first attempt
  2. Use single, clear movement description
  3. Add "smooth" or "natural" to prompt

**Problem: Inconsistent Style Across Videos**
- **Cause**: Varying prompt structure or missing style keywords
- **Solution**:
  1. Create standardized prompt templates
  2. Always include consistent style descriptors
  3. Use same seed number for similar content

**Google Veo 3 Issues and Solutions**

**Problem: Audio Doesn't Match Video**
- **Cause**: Conflicting audio and visual descriptions
- **Solution**:
  1. Ensure audio description matches visual action
  2. Be specific about timing: "person speaks while walking"
  3. Test audio-only generation first, then add video

**Problem: Limited Access or Waitlist**
- **Cause**: High demand for Veo 3 access
- **Solution**:
  1. Use Canva integration as alternative access point
  2. Apply for Google AI Studio developer access

## 6. Real-World Case Studies

### Case Study 1: Coca-Cola's AI-Generated Holiday Campaign

**Background:** In December 2024, Coca-Cola made headlines by creating their entire holiday advertising campaign using AI video generation tools, including Runway and other platforms. The campaign, titled "Create Real Magic," represented one of the first major brand initiatives to rely entirely on AI-generated video content for a global marketing campaign.

**Implementation:** Coca-Cola's creative team used a combination of AI video platforms to generate multiple versions of their classic holiday imagery, including the iconic Coca-Cola truck, winter landscapes, and family gathering scenes. The team created over 100 different video variations using AI tools, allowing for unprecedented personalization across different markets and demographics.

**Results:** The campaign generated significant media attention and achieved a 23% increase in engagement compared to their previous year's traditional video campaign. The AI-generated content enabled Coca-Cola to create localized versions for 40+ markets at a fraction of the traditional production cost, reducing campaign development time from 6 months to 6 weeks.

**Lessons Learned:** The success demonstrated that AI video generation could handle brand-critical content when properly guided by experienced creative teams. However, the campaign also highlighted the importance of human oversight in maintaining brand consistency and emotional authenticity.

**Solution:** 
1. Verify your source image is high-resolution (minimum 1920x1080)
2. Check platform quality settings - ensure "High Quality" or "4K" is selected
3. Use upscaling tools like Topaz Video AI for post-processing enhancement
4. Consider regenerating with more specific technical specifications in prompt
**Prevention:** Always start with high-quality source materials and specify resolution requirements in prompts

**Problem:** Unnatural or jerky character movement
**Symptoms:** Robotic gestures, sudden motion changes, unrealistic physics
**Solution:**
1. Simplify movement descriptions - use natural language like "gentle" or "flowing"
2. Specify realistic physics constraints in your prompt
3. Try shorter video durations for complex character animations
4. Use reference videos to guide motion expectations
**Prevention:** Study real human movement patterns and describe them naturally in prompts

**Problem:** Inconsistent object appearance across frames
**Symptoms:** Objects changing shape, color shifts, morphing between frames
**Solution:**
1. Use more detailed object descriptions in prompts
2. Specify "consistent appearance" or "stable object identity" in technical requirements
3. Try image-to-video instead of text-to-video for better consistency
4. Generate multiple versions and select the most stable result
**Prevention:** Provide detailed, specific descriptions of all objects and their properties

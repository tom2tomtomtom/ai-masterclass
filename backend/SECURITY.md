# AI Masterclass - Security Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive security measures implemented to protect the AI Masterclass application against the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities and other common security threats.

## Security Architecture

### Defense in Depth Strategy

Our security implementation follows a multi-layered approach:

1. **Network Layer**: CORS, Rate Limiting, IP Filtering
2. **Application Layer**: Input Validation, Authentication, Authorization
3. **Data Layer**: Encryption, Sanitization, Secure Storage
4. **Monitoring Layer**: Logging, Metrics, Intrusion Detection

## Implemented Security Measures

### 1. Input Validation & Sanitization (A03:2021 - Injection)

**Backend Protection:**
- `express-validator` for comprehensive input validation
- `express-mongo-sanitize` for NoSQL injection prevention
- `xss` library for XSS protection
- Custom validation middleware for enhanced security

**Frontend Protection:**
- `DOMPurify` for HTML sanitization
- Input validation utilities
- File upload validation

**Key Files:**
- `/backend/middleware/security/inputSanitization.js`
- `/backend/middleware/security/enhancedValidation.js`
- `/frontend/src/utils/security.js`

### 2. Authentication & Session Management (A07:2021 - Identification and Authentication Failures)

**Enhanced Features:**
- JWT token validation with additional security checks
- Token blacklisting for secure logout
- Session tracking and concurrent session detection
- Progressive authentication penalties
- Enhanced password requirements (12+ characters, complexity rules)

**Key Files:**
- `/backend/middleware/auth-enhanced.js`
- `/backend/middleware/security/sessionSecurity.js`
- `/backend/routes/supabase-auth-enhanced.js`

### 3. Rate Limiting & DDoS Protection

**Multi-tier Rate Limiting:**
- General API: 500 requests/15 minutes
- Authentication: 5 attempts/15 minutes (progressive penalties)
- Course Access: 200 requests/minute
- Sensitive Operations: 3 attempts/hour

**Advanced Features:**
- Progressive delay mechanisms
- IP-based tracking of failed attempts
- Suspicious IP flagging
- Honeypot endpoints for bot detection

**Key Files:**
- `/backend/middleware/security/advancedRateLimit.js`

### 4. Security Headers (A05:2021 - Security Misconfiguration)

**Comprehensive Headers:**
- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
- X-Frame-Options (Clickjacking protection)
- X-Content-Type-Options (MIME sniffing protection)
- Referrer Policy
- Permissions Policy

**Key Files:**
- `/backend/middleware/security/securityHeaders.js`

### 5. CORS Configuration (A05:2021 - Security Misconfiguration)

**Environment-Specific CORS:**
- Development: Permissive for local development
- Production: Strict origin validation
- Dynamic origin checking with logging
- Preflight optimization

**Key Files:**
- `/backend/middleware/security/secureCors.js`

### 6. Data Protection & Encryption

**Frontend Encryption:**
- AES encryption for sensitive localStorage data
- Secure storage wrapper utilities
- Client-side data validation

**Backend Protection:**
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Environment variable validation
- Secure session management

## Environment Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

```bash
# Core Security
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secure-jwt-secret-min-32-chars
NODE_ENV=production

# CORS Configuration
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-frontend-domain.com
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-frontend-domain.com,https://admin.yourdomain.com

# Optional Security Features
ADMIN_WHITELIST_IPS=192.168.1.100,10.0.0.1
RATE_LIMIT_SKIP_IPS=127.0.0.1

# Supabase Configuration
SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
```

### Production Security Checklist

#### Server Configuration
- [ ] Set `NODE_ENV=production`
- [ ] Configure proper CORS origins

## Security Testing

### Automated Testing

Run security tests:
```bash
npm run test:security
```

### Manual Testing Checklist

#### Input Validation Testing
- [ ] Test XSS payloads in all inputs
- [ ] Test SQL injection attempts
- [ ] Test file upload with malicious files
- [ ] Test oversized request bodies
- [ ] Test deeply nested JSON objects

#### Rate Limiting Testing
- [ ] Verify API rate limits are enforced
- [ ] Test authentication rate limiting
- [ ] Verify progressive penalties work
- [ ] Test rate limit headers

#### CORS Testing
- [ ] Test requests from unauthorized origins
- [ ] Verify preflight requests work correctly
- [ ] Test credential handling

## Monitoring & Alerting

### Security Events to Monitor

1. **Authentication Failures**
   - Multiple failed login attempts
   - Invalid token usage
   - Suspicious IP addresses

2. **Rate Limiting Events**
   - Rate limit exceeded
   - Honeypot triggering
   - Progressive penalties activated

3. **Input Validation Failures**
   - XSS attempt detection
   - SQL injection attempts
   - Malicious file uploads

4. **CORS Violations**
   - Unauthorized origin requests
   - Preflight failures

### Log Analysis

Security events are logged with structured data:
- Timestamp
- Event type
- IP address
- User agent
- Request details
- Security context

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Procedure

1. **Detection**: Monitor logs and alerts
2. **Assessment**: Determine severity and impact
3. **Containment**: Block malicious IPs, revoke compromised tokens
4. **Investigation**: Analyze attack vectors and data
5. **Recovery**: Apply patches, update configurations
6. **Lessons Learned**: Update security measures

### Emergency Security Actions

```bash
# Block suspicious IP (add to environment variables)
export BLOCKED_IPS="1.2.3.4,5.6.7.8"

# Rotate JWT secret (requires application restart)
export JWT_SECRET="new-secure-secret"

# Enable emergency mode (stricter rate limits)
export EMERGENCY_MODE=true
```

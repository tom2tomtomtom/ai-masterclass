## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Understand how AI models handle context and memory
- Implement strategies to maintain conversation continuity
- Use context management techniques for complex projects
- Apply memory aids and reference systems

## Understanding AI Context

### How AI Memory Works
AI models like Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini maintain context within individual conversations but have limitations:

- **Session Memory**: Information is retained within a single conversation
- **Context Window**: Limited token capacity (typically 8k-200k tokens)
- **Context Decay**: Earlier information may become less influential
- **No Persistent Memory**: Each new conversation starts fresh

### Context Management Strategies

#### 1. Conversation Summaries
At regular intervals, create summaries of key decisions and information:

\`\`\`
"Before we continue, let me summarize what we've established:
- Project goal: Automate customer support workflows
- Key requirements: 24/7 availability, multilingual support
- Current approach: Using chatbot with human escalation
- Next steps: Design the escalation criteria"
\`\`\`

#### 2. Context Anchoring
Use specific reference points to maintain focus:

\`\`\`
"Referring back to our initial requirement for 'zero-downtime deployment', 
how should we modify the proposed CI/CD pipeline?"
\`\`\`

#### 3. Progressive Context Building
Layer information systematically:

\`\`\`
"Building on our previous discussion about data privacy requirements,
and considering the GDPR compliance framework we established,
let's now address the user consent management system."
\`\`\`

## Advanced Context Techniques

### 1. Context Injection
Regularly inject key context to maintain relevance:

\`\`\`
"Given that we're working on a healthcare application with strict HIPAA requirements,
please review this database schema for potential privacy issues."
\`\`\`

### 2. Context Validation
Verify AI understanding at key points:

\`\`\`
"Before we proceed, can you confirm your understanding of our project constraints:
budget, timeline, and technical requirements?"
\`\`\`

### 3. Context Segmentation
Break complex projects into manageable conversation segments:

- **Session 1**: Requirements gathering and initial planning
- **Session 2**: Technical architecture design
- **Session 3**: Implementation strategy
- **Session 4**: Testing and deployment planning

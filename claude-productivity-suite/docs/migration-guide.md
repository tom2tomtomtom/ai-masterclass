# ðŸ”„ Migration Guide: Understanding v2.0 and v3.0

## Overview

The Claude Productivity Suite has evolved to serve two distinct audiences while maintaining compatibility:

- **v2.0**: Command-based system for developers wanting precise control
- **v3.0**: Natural language system for rapid development without coding

## Key Differences

### v2.0 (Agent-Based)
```
Developer â†’ Specific Commands â†’ Precise Output
```
- Multiple specialized agents
- Granular control
- Explicit commands
- Technical knowledge required
- Step-by-step workflow

### v3.0 (Natural Language)
```
Anyone â†’ Natural Language â†’ AI Handles Everything
```
- Single AI interface
- Automatic decisions
- Plain English
- No technical knowledge
- One-command solutions

## Command Mapping

| Task | v2.0 Commands | v3.0 Command |
|------|---------------|--------------|
| Plan a feature | `/plan-product` â†’ `/create-spec` | `/build-this "feature description"` |
| Fix errors | `/analyze-codebase` â†’ `/fix-common-issues` | `/fix-this` |
| Check quality | `/monitor-quality` â†’ `/analyze-codebase` | `/project-health` |
| Deploy | `/pre-deploy-check` â†’ `/railway-deploy` | `/build-this "deploy to production"` |
| Refactor | `/refactor-smart` | `/build-this "improve code quality"` |

## When to Use Each System

### Use v2.0 When You Need:
- Precise control over implementation
- Specific optimization strategies
- Custom workflows
- Team standardization
- Deep technical analysis
- Learning how things work

### Use v3.0 When You Need:
- Quick prototypes
- MVP development
- Non-technical stakeholders
- Rapid iteration
- Simple CRUD apps
- Demonstration builds

## Hybrid Workflows

### Approach 1: Prototype â†’ Production
```bash
# 1. Quick prototype with v3.0
/build-this "user management system with roles"

# 2. Analyze what was built
/analyze-product

# 3. Optimize with v2.0
/refactor-smart
/clean-codebase

# 4. Add advanced features with v2.0
/create-spec advanced-permissions
/execute-tasks

# 5. Ensure quality
/fix-and-test
/pre-deploy-check
```

### Approach 2: Parallel Development
```bash
# Business logic with v3.0
/build-this "invoice generation system"

# Infrastructure with v2.0
/create-spec database-optimization
/execute-tasks

# Quick fixes with v3.0
/fix-this

# Quality assurance with v2.0
/test-core-flows
```

### Approach 3: Teaching & Learning
```bash
# Build with v3.0 in learning mode
/learning-mode on
/build-this "REST API with authentication"

# Understand with v2.0 analysis
/analyze-codebase
/monitor-quality

# Improve with v2.0 guidance
/refactor-smart --explain
```

## Migration Scenarios

### From v2.0 to v3.0
If you want simpler development:
1. Your v2.0 commands still work
2. Try v3.0 for new features
3. Gradually adopt natural language
4. Keep v2.0 for optimization

### From v3.0 to v2.0
If you need more control:
1. Run `/analyze-product` on v3.0 output
2. Use v2.0 to understand structure
3. Apply v2.0 optimization commands
4. Maintain with v2.0 workflows

### Using Both Together
Recommended approach:
1. Rapid development with v3.0
2. Quality control with v2.0
3. Deployment prep with v2.0
4. Emergency fixes with v3.0

## Configuration Compatibility

Both systems share:
- Global standards (`~/.claude-suite/standards/`)
- Project configuration (`.claude-suite/project/`)
- Templates directory
- Report outputs

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Business First, Technical Second
```bash
# Business requirements with v3.0
/build-this "customer portal with order tracking"

# Technical optimization with v2.0
/analyze-codebase
/refactor-smart --performance
```

### Pattern 2: Learn by Doing
```bash
# Build with v3.0 explanations
/learning-mode on
/build-this "real-time chat application"

# Study with v2.0 analysis
/analyze-product
/monitor-quality --detailed
```

### Pattern 3: Team Collaboration
```bash
# Non-technical PM uses v3.0
/build-this "reporting dashboard"

# Developer team uses v2.0
/analyze-codebase
/create-spec performance-improvements
/execute-tasks
```

## Best Practices

1. **Don't abandon either system** - They complement each other
2. **Start with your comfort zone** - Developers â†’ v2.0, Non-coders â†’ v3.0
3. **Experiment with both** - Find your optimal workflow
4. **Use v3.0 for speed** - When time is critical
5. **Use v2.0 for precision** - When quality is critical

## FAQ

### Q: Can I use both in the same project?
A: Yes! They work together seamlessly.

### Q: Will v3.0 replace v2.0?
A: No, they serve different purposes and audiences.

### Q: Which is "better"?
A: Neither - use the right tool for the job.

### Q: Can v3.0 do everything v2.0 can?
A: Conceptually yes, but with less control.

### Q: Should I learn both?
A: Eventually yes, but start with what matches your skills.

## Conclusion

The Claude Productivity Suite now offers the best of both worlds:
- **Power** through v2.0's precise commands
- **Simplicity** through v3.0's natural language

Choose based on your needs, not on what's "newer". Both systems will continue to evolve and improve together.

## 🌟 Pro Tips

1. **Start Simple**: Describe basic version first, add features later
2. **Use Templates**: Faster than building from scratch
3. **Check Health**: Daily `/project-health` prevents issues
4. **Save Progress**: Create checkpoints before big changes
5. **Learn Mode**: Turn on when trying new things

## 📱 Mobile-Friendly Commands

Short versions for quick access:
- `/build` → `/build-this`
- `/fix` → `/fix-this`

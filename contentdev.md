- **Tables**: courses, modules, lessons, prompts, quizzes, tasks
- **Seeding Scripts**: `/backend/seed-complete-courses.js` and related files
- **Content Structure**: JSON objects with structured lesson content, prompts, and assessments

### **Content Management Process:**
1. **Modify Seeding Scripts**: Update content in JavaScript seeding files
2. **Run Database Seeding**: Execute scripts to populate Supabase
3. **API Integration**: Frontend pulls content from database via API
4. **Version Control**: All changes tracked in Git repository

### **Implementation Approach:**
- Update seeding scripts with enhanced content
- Test locally before deploying to production
- Use structured content format for consistency
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing API endpoints

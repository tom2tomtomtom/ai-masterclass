    A[API Gateway] --> B[User Service]
    A --> C[Order Service]
    A --> D[Payment Service]
    C --> B
    C --> D
    D --> E[Notification Service]
    B --> F[User Database]
    C --> G[Order Database]
    D --> H[Payment Database]
```

### Data Flow
1. **User Registration**: API Gateway → User Service → User Database
2. **Order Creation**: API Gateway → Order Service → User Service → Order Database
3. **Payment Processing**: Order Service → Payment Service → Payment Database → Notification Service

### Deployment Architecture
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes
- **Service Mesh**: Istio for service-to-service communication
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus and Grafana
- **Logging**: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
```

### 6.3 Code Documentation Standards

Claude Code can help maintain consistent documentation standards across your codebase.

#### JSDoc Generation

```javascript
// Undocumented function
function calculateOrderTotal(items, taxRate, discountCode) {
  let subtotal = items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + (item.price * item.quantity), 0);
  let discount = discountCode ? applyDiscount(subtotal, discountCode) : 0;
  let tax = (subtotal - discount) * taxRate;
  return subtotal - discount + tax;
}
```

**Claude Code Documentation**:
```bash
> Add comprehensive JSDoc comments to the calculateOrderTotal function
```

**Generated Documentation**:
```javascript
/**
 * Calculates the total cost of an order including tax and discounts
 * 
 * @param {Array<Object>} items - Array of order items
 * @param {Object} items[].price - Price per unit of the item
 * @param {Object} items[].quantity - Quantity of the item
 * @param {number} taxRate - Tax rate as a decimal (e.g., 0.08 for 8%)
 * @param {string|null} discountCode - Optional discount code to apply
 * @returns {number} The total order amount including tax and discounts
 * 
 * @example
 * const items = [
 *   { price: 10.00, quantity: 2 },
 *   { price: 5.00, quantity: 1 }
 * ];
 * const total = calculateOrderTotal(items, 0.08, 'SAVE10');
 * console.log(total); // 23.40
 */
function calculateOrderTotal(items, taxRate, discountCode) {
  let subtotal = items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + (item.price * item.quantity), 0);
  let discount = discountCode ? applyDiscount(subtotal, discountCode) : 0;
  let tax = (subtotal - discount) * taxRate;
  return subtotal - discount + tax;
}
```

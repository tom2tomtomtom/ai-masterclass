### Step 2: Mastering Prompt Engineering for Professional Results

**üß† The Anatomy of a Perfect DALL-E Prompt**

A professional DALL-E prompt follows this proven structure:

**[Subject] + [Action/Pose] + [Environment/Setting] + [Style] + [Technical Specifications] + [Mood/Atmosphere]**

**Before/After Example:**

‚ùå **Basic Prompt**: "A person working on a computer"

‚úÖ **Professional Prompt**: "A focused professional woman in her 30s typing on a sleek laptop at a modern standing desk, bright minimalist office with large windows, natural daylight, clean corporate photography style, shot with professional camera, shallow depth of field, inspiring and productive atmosphere"

**üî• Advanced Prompt Engineering Techniques:**

**1. Specificity Layering**
Build your prompts in layers of increasing detail:
- **Base Layer**: Core subject and action
- **Context Layer**: Environment and setting details
- **Style Layer**: Visual style and technical specifications
- **Emotion Layer**: Mood, atmosphere, and feeling

**2. Style Reference Integration**
```
"[Your subject description], in the style of [specific reference], [technical details], [mood]"

Example: "A modern office workspace, in the style of Apple product photography, clean minimalist aesthetic, bright natural lighting, professional corporate feel"
```

**3. Technical Specification Mastery**
```
Photography Terms: "shot with Canon EOS R5, 85mm lens, f/1.4 aperture, professional studio lighting"

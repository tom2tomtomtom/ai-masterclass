Current situation analysis:
[PROVIDE CONTEXT - market position, challenges, opportunities]

I need you to think systematically about positioning:

CATEGORY CONTEXT:
- How do customers currently think about this category?
- What are the dominant positioning territories?
- Where are the white spaces and opportunities?
- How might we reframe the category entirely?

COMPETITIVE MAPPING:
- Where do competitors position themselves?
- What territories are overcrowded vs. empty?
- Which positions are vulnerable to attack?
- How can we create a unique space?

CUSTOMER INSIGHTS:
- What do customers really care about that brands miss?
- What emotional and functional needs are unmet?
- How do they make decisions in this category?
- What would make them completely switch loyalty?

POSITIONING OPTIONS:
Develop 3 distinct positioning directions:
1. Functional differentiation approach
2. Emotional territory ownership
3. Category redefinition strategy

For each positioning:
- Core positioning statement
- Supporting proof points and reasons to believe
- Emotional benefit and rational benefit
- Competitive vulnerability it exploits
- Communication implications and messaging

RECOMMENDED DIRECTION:
- Which positioning has the highest potential?
- Why this is the right choice for this brand at this time?
- Implementation roadmap and requirements
- Risks and mitigation strategies

Make this positioning both differentiating and defensible.

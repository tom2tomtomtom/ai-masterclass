  const [tasks, setTasks] = useState<Task[]>([]);
  const [filter, setFilter] = useState<'all' | 'active' | 'completed'>('all');

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchTasks();
  }, [filter]);

  const fetchTasks = async () => {
    try {
      const data = await taskApi.getTasks(filter);
      setTasks(data);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Failed to fetch tasks:', error);

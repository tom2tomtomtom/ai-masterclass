### ROI Calculation Framework

**Investment Calculation**:
```
Total Investment = GPT Development Time + Training Time + Subscription Costs + Maintenance Time

Example:
- GPT Development: 40 hours × $100/hour = $4,000
- Team Training: 20 hours × $75/hour = $1,500
- ChatGPT Subscriptions: 10 users × $30/month × 12 months = $3,600
- Maintenance: 5 hours/month × $100/hour × 12 months = $6,000
Total Investment: $15,100
```

**Return Calculation**:
```
Monthly Return = Time Savings × Hourly Rate + Quality Improvements × Revenue Impact

Example:
- Time Savings: 50 hours/month × $100/hour = $5,000
- Quality Improvements: 20% faster client approval × $2,000 revenue impact = $400
Monthly Return: $5,400
Annual Return: $5,400 × 12 = $64,800

ROI = (Annual Return - Annual Investment) / Annual Investment × 100
ROI = ($64,800 - $15,100) / $15,100 × 100 = 329%
```

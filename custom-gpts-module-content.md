```
Monthly Return = Time Savings Ã— Hourly Rate + Quality Improvements Ã— Revenue Impact

Example:
- Time Savings: 50 hours/month Ã— $100/hour = $5,000
- Quality Improvements: 20% faster client approval Ã— $2,000 revenue impact = $400
Monthly Return: $5,400
Annual Return: $5,400 Ã— 12 = $64,800

ROI = (Annual Return - Annual Investment) / Annual Investment Ã— 100
ROI = ($64,800 - $15,100) / $15,100 Ã— 100 = 329%
```

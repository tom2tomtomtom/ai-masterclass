## üìö **CORE CONTENT**

### **Section 1: The AI Opportunity Assessment Framework**

The AI Opportunity Assessment Framework helps you systematically evaluate potential AI applications using four critical dimensions:

#### **The Four Assessment Dimensions**

**1. Business Impact Potential**
- **Revenue Growth**: Can AI increase sales, customer acquisition, or pricing?
- **Cost Reduction**: Can AI reduce operational expenses or improve efficiency?
- **Risk Mitigation**: Can AI reduce business risks or improve compliance?
- **Competitive Advantage**: Can AI create sustainable differentiation?

**2. Implementation Feasibility**
- **Data Availability**: Do you have sufficient, quality data for AI?
- **Technical Complexity**: How complex is the technical implementation?
- **Resource Requirements**: What budget, time, and expertise are needed?
- **Change Management**: How significant is the organizational change required?

**3. Strategic Alignment**
- **Business Goals**: Does this AI opportunity support core business objectives?
- **Company Culture**: Does it align with organizational values and readiness?
- **Market Timing**: Is the market ready for this AI application?
- **Long-term Vision**: Does it support long-term strategic direction?

**4. Risk Assessment**
- **Technical Risk**: What could go wrong technically?
- **Business Risk**: What business risks does implementation create?
- **Regulatory Risk**: Are there compliance or regulatory concerns?
- **Competitive Risk**: What happens if competitors implement first?

#### **Real-World Application Context**
This framework has been used successfully by companies ranging from Fortune 500 enterprises to early-stage startups, helping them identify AI opportunities that generated 15-300% ROI within 12 months.

### **Section 2: Assessment Methodology**

#### **Step-by-Step Assessment Process**

**Step 1: Business Context Analysis**
Begin by mapping your current business landscape:
- Core business processes and their performance metrics
- Major pain points and inefficiencies
- Current technology stack and capabilities
- Competitive landscape and market pressures

**Step 2: Opportunity Identification**
Use these prompts to brainstorm potential AI applications:
- "What repetitive tasks consume significant time in our business?"
- "Where do we make decisions based on pattern recognition?"
- "What customer experience improvements would create the most value?"
- "Which business processes have high variability or unpredictability?"

**Step 3: Framework Application**
For each identified opportunity, score 1-5 on each dimension:
- Business Impact: 1 = Minimal impact, 5 = Transformational impact
- Feasibility: 1 = Very difficult, 5 = Easy to implement
- Strategic Alignment: 1 = Poor fit, 5 = Perfect alignment
- Risk Level: 1 = High risk, 5 = Low risk

**Step 4: Prioritization Matrix**
Plot opportunities on a matrix comparing Impact vs. Feasibility to identify quick wins and strategic investments.

## üî® **HANDS-ON EXERCISE**

### **Exercise: AI Opportunity Assessment for Your Business**

**Objective**: Complete a comprehensive AI opportunity assessment for your specific business context
**Time Required**: 20 minutes
**Deliverable**: Completed assessment worksheet with prioritized opportunities

#### **Exercise Steps**

**1. Business Context Mapping** (5 minutes)

   - ‚úÖ **Checkpoint**: You have 5+ specific AI opportunity ideas

**3. Framework Assessment** (8 minutes)
   - Score each opportunity on the four dimensions (1-5 scale)
   - Calculate total scores and identify top 3-5 opportunities
   - Document rationale for scores
   - ‚úÖ **Checkpoint**: All opportunities scored and ranked

**4. Prioritization and Planning** (2 minutes)
   - Create priority matrix plotting Impact vs. Feasibility
   - Identify quick wins (high feasibility, medium+ impact)
   - Identify strategic investments (high impact, medium+ feasibility)
   - ‚úÖ **Checkpoint**: Clear prioritization with next steps identified

#### **Expected Deliverables**
- Completed AI Opportunity Assessment worksheet

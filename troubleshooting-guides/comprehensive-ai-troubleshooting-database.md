## 🚨 CRITICAL SUCCESS PATTERNS

### **The 5-Minute Rule**
**Problem**: AI tool not working as expected  
**FIRST**: Try these 5 universal fixes (works 70% of the time):
1. **Refresh/Restart**: Close and reopen the tool
2. **Clear Prompt**: Start with a simple, direct prompt
3. **Check Limits**: Verify you haven't hit usage limits
4. **Switch Models**: Try a different model within the platform
5. **Rephrase Request**: Use different wording for the same task

### **Platform Priority Hierarchy**
When multiple platforms could solve a problem:
1. **Use what's working**: Don't switch if current tool is functional
2. **Match task to strength**: Strategy → Claude, Visuals → Midjourney, Data → ChatGPT
3. **Consider team skill**: Use what your team knows best
4. **Factor in cost**: Free tiers first, then paid, then enterprise

## 🤖 CHATGPT/OPENAI TROUBLESHOOTING

### **Model Selection Issues**

#### **Problem**: "I don't see GPT-4o/o3/GPT-4.5 in my model selector"
**Diagnosis**: Account tier limitation or gradual rollout
**Solution**:
1. **Check Account Type**:
   - Free users: Only GPT-4o mini available
   - Plus users: GPT-4o, limited o3, GPT-4.5 (rolling out)
   - Pro users: All models including o3-pro
   - Enterprise: Full access to all models

2. **Gradual Rollout Check**:
   - GPT-4.5: Pro users first, then Plus users next week
   - o3: Available to Plus/Pro/Team users now
   - New features often roll out gradually

3. **Interface Location**:
   - Models in dropdown at top of chat
   - Some models in "More models" section
   - Custom GPTs can access different model sets

**Prevention**: Upgrade account if needed, wait for rollouts, check OpenAI announcements

#### **Problem**: "Model keeps switching back to GPT-4o"
**Diagnosis**: Default model behavior or session limits
**Solution**:
1. **Check Message Limits**:
   - o3 has lower usage limits than GPT-4o
   - Plus: 40 messages per 3 hours on o3
   - System may auto-switch when limits reached

2. **Start New Conversation**:
   - Model selection resets between conversations
   - Always select preferred model at start

3. **Use Projects Feature**:
   - Create project with specific model preference
   - Model selection persists within project

**Prevention**: Monitor usage limits, use projects for consistent model selection

### **Prompt and Response Issues**

#### **Problem**: "ChatGPT responses are too generic/unhelpful"
**Diagnosis**: Insufficient context or prompting technique
**Solution**:
1. **Add Specific Context**:
   ```
   Instead of: "Write a social media post"
   Use: "Write a LinkedIn post for a B2B SaaS startup launching 
   a new analytics feature. Target: marketing managers at 
   companies with 100-500 employees. Tone: professional but 
   engaging. Include a question to drive engagement."
   ```

2. **Use Role-Based Prompting**:
   ```
   "You are a senior creative director at a top advertising 
   agency. Our client is [specific details]. Create a campaign 
   concept that..."
   ```

3. **Provide Examples**:
   - Show 1-2 examples of desired output style
   - Reference successful campaigns or content
   - Specify exact format requirements

4. **Iterate and Refine**:
   - Ask for 3-5 variations
   - Request specific improvements
   - Build on best elements

**Prevention**: Always include context, role, audience, tone, and desired outcome

#### **Problem**: "Getting inconsistent results from same prompt"
**Diagnosis**: Model randomness or context bleeding
**Solution**:
1. **Use Temperature Control** (API users):
   - Lower temperature (0.1-0.3) for consistent results
   - Higher temperature (0.7-0.9) for creative variation

2. **Start Fresh Conversations**:
   - Previous context affects responses
   - Start new chat for unrelated tasks

3. **Add Consistency Instructions**:
   ```
   "Maintain consistent tone and style throughout. 
   Follow exactly the same format for each response."
   ```

4. **Use Custom GPTs**:
   - Create specialized GPT with consistent instructions
   - Better for repeated similar tasks

**Prevention**: Use new conversations for different projects, create custom GPTs for consistency

### **Tool Integration Problems**

#### **Problem**: "Code Interpreter/Python tool not working"
**Diagnosis**: File format, size, or complexity issues
**Solution**:
1. **File Size Check**:
   - Maximum file size: 100MB
   - If larger, split into smaller files
   - Use data samples for testing

2. **Supported Formats**:
   - CSV, Excel, JSON, PDF, images
   - Text files with clear structure
   - Avoid complex nested formats

3. **Clear Instructions**:
   ```
   "Analyze this CSV file. First, show me the column headers 
   and first 5 rows. Then create a visualization showing 
   trends by month."
   ```

4. **Step-by-Step Approach**:
   - Break complex analysis into smaller steps
   - Verify each step before proceeding
   - Ask for code explanations

**Prevention**: Use supported formats, clear step-by-step instructions, verify data quality

#### **Problem**: "DALL-E not generating requested images"
**Diagnosis**: Content policy violation or unclear description
**Solution**:
1. **Check Content Policies**:
   - No branded content (logos, trademarks)
   - No public figures or celebrities
   - No violent or inappropriate content

2. **Improve Description Clarity**:
   ```
   Instead of: "Create a business image"
   Use: "Create a professional photo of a modern office space 
   with diverse team members collaborating around a conference 
   table, natural lighting, corporate but friendly atmosphere"
   ```

3. **Use Alternative Approaches**:
   - Focus on concepts rather than specific brands
   - Describe style and mood instead of specific people
   - Use metaphors and abstract representations

4. **Iterate with Feedback**:
   - Generate multiple variations
   - Refine based on what works
   - Combine elements from different versions

**Prevention**: Learn content policies, use detailed descriptions, avoid restricted content

### **Enterprise and Team Issues**

#### **Problem**: "Team members can't access ChatGPT Enterprise features"
**Diagnosis**: Permission settings or account configuration
**Solution**:
1. **Check User Roles**:
   - Admin vs Member permissions
   - Feature access by role level
   - Billing and usage limits per user

2. **Verify SSO Setup**:
   - Single sign-on configuration
   - Domain restrictions
   - User provisioning status

3. **Contact Admin**:
   - Request access to specific features
   - Verify team workspace settings
   - Check usage allowances

4. **Alternative Solutions**:
   - Use available features while waiting
   - Individual accounts for immediate needs
   - Fallback to free tier tools

**Prevention**: Understand enterprise setup, communicate with admin, plan for access delays
